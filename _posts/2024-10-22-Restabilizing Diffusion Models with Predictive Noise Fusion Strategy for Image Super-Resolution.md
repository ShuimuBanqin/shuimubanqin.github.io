## Abstract
Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has recently become a significant development in the field of Computer Vision, allowing for implicit, neural network-based scene representation and novel view synthesis.

## Theory
The radiance field describes color and volume density for every point and for every viewing direction in the scene. This is written as
