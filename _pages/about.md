I’m a college student from South China University of Technology, majoring in software engineering, and I am about to start my graduate studies here. I am interested in machine learning, and I will share some of my notes from reading papers. I warmly welcome any discussion.

I am currently feeling a bit uncertain about my graduate studies. If you have any guidance or experiences to share, I would be deeply grateful. I am also eager to build academic connections with you.

This website won’t be just a formal academic homepage. I might also share snapshots of life, personal thoughts, and other things I find valuable.
